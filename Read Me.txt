Concept
=======

The basic idea of allowing C/C++ (and other platforms) to use C# assemblies is
to use the IL disassembler in conjunction with the IL assembler.  In between,
the "C# DLL for C" utility will automatically scan the .il data and produce
exports that are visible from C/C++.  This process is also known as a
"Reverse P/Invoke".



Building
========

During the build process, a batch file will automatically execute as a
post-build event that prepares your plugin's binaries for C/C++'s use.  This
step will also copy the plugin to a new folder at the root of this project
called /_compiled/.  These can be used directly in Rainmeter (use the 32-bit
version with the 32-bit installation of Rainmeter and the 64-bit version with
the 64-bit installation of Rainmeter).

You may notice that the solution file contains both the x86 and x64 projects
and are both built at the same time.  They both share the same souce code
in /Shared Source/.  If you change the source code for one project, it will
change it for both.  If you add new files to the project, by default, Visual
Studio (or Visual C# Express, depending on your version) will only include it
in one project.  Simply right-click the project in the development environment
to 'Add existing file' to make sure that both get code updates.



Updates
=======

Check in with the Rainmeter development team from time to time or the SVN
for updates to the template.  Most notably, the toolkit (Rainmeter.cs),
which provides your plugin with the necessary tools to facilitate rapid
development in C#.



C# Template Toolkit Reference
